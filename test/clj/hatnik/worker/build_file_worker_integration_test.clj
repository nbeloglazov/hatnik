;;;
;;; Integrations test that verifies that actions in projects that based on build
;;  files are updated periodically.
;;;
;;; Following situation is exercised:
;;; 1. Create a project based on a build file that served locally. Build file
;;;    contains 2 libs: clojure, ring.
;;; 2. Once project is created we modify original build file by replacing ring
;;;    with quil and increasing version of clojure. Version increased not in
;;;    build file, but in mocked 'latest-release` version.
;;; 3. SyncBuildFileActionsJob should be executed and it should remove the
;;;    action based on ring, create new action for quil and don't modify
;;;    clojure action even though version is "changed". Only UpdateActionsJob
;;;    can change versions of libraries in action.
