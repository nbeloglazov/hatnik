;;;
;;; Integration test that verifies that worker job is executed periodically.
;;; The job checks latest versions of all libraries, performs actions and
;;; then updates changed actions.
;;; We'll use REST API to create 2 users. Then we'll create an action of
;;; each type for the first user and single action for the second.
;;; Along with regular actions we'll create build-file project for the
;;; first user to check that build-file action also processed correctly.
;;;
;;; We'll also rebind 'latest-release' function so it returns new version
;;; every time it called. Thus each action will be "released" each time
;;; worker job is executed.
;;;
;;; To verify that actions are performed we'll mock send-email and
;;; create-github-issue functions and check that they're called with
;;; apropriate arguments.
;;;
;;; We'll wait until job is executed 2 times and then verify all arguments.
